Greleton - Groonworld HTML & CSS skeleton Extension
MIT License, (c)2019 by @Groonworld

Greleton is a simple extension which adds "File > Insert HTML Skeleton" and "File > Insert CSS Skeleton" menu items. 
These options insert template code that is common to pretty much all my HTML/CSS projects. Developed in and for Brackets.io Editor.

TO DO:
 -  IMPORTANT: Figure out how to insert text over multiple lines. This extension is quite useless wihtout this.

 -  FUTURE: Set document syntax highlighting to CSS or HTML, accordingly.
 -  FUTURE: Add settings to allow users to customize their skeletons.
