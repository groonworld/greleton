Greleton - Groonworld HTML & CSS skeleton Extension
MIT License, (c)2019 by @Groonworld

Greleton is a simple extension which adds "File > Insert HTML Skeleton" and "File > Insert CSS Skeleton" menu items. 
These options insert template code that is common to pretty much all my HTML/CSS projects. Developed in and for Brackets.io Editor.

DONE:
 - [x] Important: Figure out how to insert text over multiple lines. This extension is quite useless wihtout this. 

TO DO: 
 - [ ]: Automatize creation of the new document.
 - [ ]: Set document syntax highlighting of the file to CSS or HTML, accordingly.
 - [ ]: Externalize strings of template code from the main.js file.
 - [ ]: Allow users to customize the code templates. Add UI for this.
